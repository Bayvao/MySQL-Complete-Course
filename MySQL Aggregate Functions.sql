################## MIN and MAX Basics ####################

SELECT MIN(released_year)

SELECT MIN(pages) FROM books;
 
SELECT MAX(pages) 
FROM books;
 
SELECT MAX(released_year)

########## A Problem with Min and Max ############

SELECT * FROM books 
WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) 
                FROM books); 
 
SELECT title, pages FROM books 
WHERE pages = (SELECT Max(pages) 
                FROM books); 
 
SELECT title, pages FROM books 
WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) 
                FROM books); 
 
SELECT * FROM books 
ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;
 
SELECT title, pages FROM books 
ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;
 
SELECT * FROM books 
ORDER BY pages DESC LIMIT 1;

########## Using Min and Max with Group By ############

SELECT author_fname, 
       author_lname, 
       Min(released_year) 
FROM   books 
GROUP  BY author_lname, 
          author_fname;
 
SELECT

  author_lname,
  Max(pages)
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname,
         author_fname;
 
SELECT

  MAX(pages) AS 'longest book'
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname,

########### The Sum Function ###########

SELECT SUM(pages)
FROM books;

############ The Avg Function ############

SELECT AVG(released_year) 
FROM books;
 
SELECT AVG(pages) 
FROM books;
 
SELECT AVG(stock_quantity) 
FROM books 
GROUP BY released_year;
 
SELECT released_year, AVG(stock_quantity) 
FROM books 
GROUP BY released_year;
 
SELECT author_fname, author_lname, AVG(pages) FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;

######## CHALLENGES #########
